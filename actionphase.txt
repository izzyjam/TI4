Action Phase
- Go around in Initiative Order until everyone has passed:
  - Choose 1 per turn:
    - Activate a system (Tactical Action)
    - Use your Strategy card (Strategic Action)
    - Use "Action:" abilities on components (Component Action)
  - Cannot pass until you've at least completed your Strategic Action

Tactical Action
- Place a Tactic command token on system to Activate it
  - Cannot activate if system already has one of your Tactic tokens
- May have units MOVE TO (not from) active system
- Space combat (if more than 1 player)
- Invasion (send ground troops to planet)
- Production if system contains a Space Dock (limited by Fleet pool)

Strategic Action
- Use Strategy card's Primary Ability
- OTHER players may use Secondary Ability (often at the cost of Strategy command tokens)
- Must use this at some point in the round before you're able to pass turn
- Players who have passed may still take part in Secondary Ability
- Flip card over after. It's no longer available this round.

Component Action
- Game components that say "Action:", ie Action Cards, Faction Sheets, Tech cards

Trades
- Each turn active player can make 1 deal with each other player
- Promissory Notes, Commodities, Trade Gods and favors can be traded
- Can do so even mid combat
- If components are involved (ie Commodities), players must be neighbours (share borders)
- Simple (ie Commodities for Commodities) or immediate (goods for retreat) are BINDING DEALS
- Delayed deals (ie goods for favor in next turn) are NON-BINDING and can be honoured or broken

Passing
- Only available after Strategy card has been used
- Can still participate in other players' Strategy cards after passing
