Agenda Phase
- Unlocked once Mecatol Rex has been claimed

- Speaker draws first Agenda
- Players starting from left of Speaker announce their votes (Speaker votes last)
- Vote by exhausting any number of planets
- 1 point of Influence = 1 vote For or Against the Agenda (or to elect a player/planet, depending on card)
- Trade Goods cannot be used as Influence for votes
- Players cannot vote for more than 1 option, but may abstain
- Speaker breaks ties
- Resolve Agenda
  - Directives tend to be 1 time effects, while Laws will stay in play if passed

- Speaker then draws a SECOND Agenda
- Same procedure, except planets that already voted (exhausted) CANNOT be used

- Players may make deals during each vote to bribe other players
  - Components may be traded even if players are not neighbours

- Ready all planets after both votes, then New Round
